# **Welcome to Biostatsquid's Github!**

## **What is Biostatsquid?**
Hi! I'm happy you found Biostatsquid. My name is Laura, I am a bioinformatician with a passion for molecular pathology and translational medicine. In plain English, I like playing around with data to better understand human diseases - with the aim of improving patients lives!
Biostatsquid is a personal project to share my experience and knowledge as a bioinformatician. The dry lab is really fun, and you donâ€™t need to be a biostatistician or computer scientist to learn how to code!
If my scripts, tutorials and posts help you in any way it will make me really happy. Like you, I am continuously learning. So if you find improvements to my code, please share!

## **What can I find in this Github?**
Here, you will find bioinformatics tutorials on different topics, usually beginner-level. If you are looking for more advanced coding scripts, check out my other GitHub account (work in progress!).
This is (more or less) the structure of this GitHub:
- Analysis: tool- or method-specific scripts. For example: scRNAseq analysis scripts, survival analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, cell type annotation...
  - Survival_analysis.
  - scRNAseq
    - 1_Preprocessing
    - 2_Cell_type_annotation
    - 3_DGEA
- Dataviz: data visualisation tutorials and code snippets. Heatmaps, volcano plots or just little tricks to make plotting easy!
