In this blogpost, I share some of the top **(bio)statistics** resources which have helped me understand better stats behind research and (bio)data analysis. Statistics can be really fun, and building a strong foundation is essential for biological data analysis! These are some of my favourite books, videos and cool websites that have made my biostats learning easier. Hope you find them useful!

So if you are ready... let's dive in!

<hr class="section-divider">


Here are some resources to get you started in your biostats journey!


### Online materials

<ul>
<li>[**An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR)**](https://www.statlearning.com/) – The gold standard for machine learning and statistical modeling, with R code examples. Free PDF available online.</li>
<li>[**Modern Statistics for Modern Biology**](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/) by Susan Holmes and Wolfgang Huber – Specifically designed for computational biology, covering essential statistical methods with real biological datasets. Available free online.</li>
<li>[**Introductory Biostatistics with R**](https://tuos-bio-data-skills.github.io/intro-stats-book/) – Excellent for beginners, covering fundamental biostatistical methods with clear R examples.</li>
</ul>

### Video Courses and Youtube channels

<ul>
<li>[**StatQuest with Josh Starmer**](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest) – Phenomenal YouTube channel breaking down complex statistical concepts (PCA, regression, p-values) into digestible, visual explanations. His videos are legendary in the community.</li>
<li>[**Harvard's Statistics 110: Probability**](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home) – Free course by Joe Blitzstein, excellent foundation in probability theory.</li>

<li>The Art of Statistics by David Spiegelhalter</li>
<li>Naked Statistics</li>
<li>Statistics Done Wrong: The Woefully Complete Guide</li>
<li>How to Lie with Statistics</li>
<li>The Signal and the Noise (Nate Silver)</li>
